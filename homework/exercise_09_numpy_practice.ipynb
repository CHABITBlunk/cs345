    "The definition can be applied either to the columns or rows of the matrix, resulting in an array of `number_of_zeros` values for each column/row.  Your task is to write a function that computes `number_of_zeros` for a 2-d array.  You may not use the NumPy functions count_nonzero, nonzero, and argwhere.\n",
